title: My first Ludum Dare
---

I have committed [my first entry ever](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=125011) to a [Ludum Dare](http://ldjam.com/)! I'm excited as a childish child on Christmas Eve.

[A friend](https://github.com/ErikLarsson82) told me he was joining this time, so I thought "varf√∂r inte?" (which is Swedish for "why not?") and spent my weekend making a game.

Ludum Dare is an event where people all over the world create games. The idea is to jumpstart game development, but I think equally important to learn to actually finish up your game. To help with creativity there is always a special theme for each event, that is revealed when the event starts. This time (Ludum Dare #37) the theme was "One Room".

It was fun fun fun and I will be doing it again!
